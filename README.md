# Arabic-license-plate-detection-and-recognition
The aim of the project "Make Garage System" is to develop a system that can detect and classify license plates of vehicles entering a garage.

The system consists of three phases to recognize the license plate:
  The first phase detects the plate.
  The second phase segments the characters and crops them from the plate.
  The third phase classifies the cropped letters and numbers.
