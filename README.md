# Arabic-license-plate-detection-and-recognition
The aim of the project "Make Garage System" is to develop a system that can detect and classify license plates of vehicles entering a garage.

The system consists of three phases to recognize the license plate:

  1- The first phase detects the plate.
  
  2- The second phase segments the characters and crops them from the plate.
  
  3- The third phase classifies the cropped letters and numbers.
